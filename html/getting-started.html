            Before we really get started with programming, we need to first 
            understand what is programming and what it allows you to do. A 
            computer is a powerful tool that is capable of doing various things. 
            But in order for it to work as we expected, it must follow some set 
            of instructions. If we want to build some software that can be used 
            by someone else, we must provide those instructions ourselves. 
            Essentially, programming is the process of writing these instructions 
            for computers, and they eventually combine into an application 
            that can be used by someone else. Because computers only read 
            binary codes, we must rely on programming languages to communicate 
            with a computer. Programming languages consist of bundles of keywords 
            and syntax that are easier to understand for humans, codes are written 
            in a programming language would eventually be converted into binary 
            codes that computers can read. So the best way to get started with 
            programming is to get familiar with one of the programming languages. 
            Below are few good programming languages to start with.

                        It is best known for its easy to read syntax, the syntax is
                        very similar to English. Because of this, it is one of the most
                        popular languages for learning programming. It is also really
                        good at working with data.

                        A low-level language (closer to the hardware) that was designed
                        towards system programming. Because it is closer to the hardware,
                        it runs extremely fast. It is often used to build software that
                        requires fast performance, like operating systems and video games.
                        Because it is a low-level language, it is relatively difficult to
                        learn compared to Python and JavaScript. However, it is a good
                        language for learning programming fundamentals because it has
                        access to low-level features like pointers and memory management,
                        which allows people to truly understand how programs work internally.
                        That's why many schools use C++ to teach programming (including Hunter).
