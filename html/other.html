        <p class="other-text">
            Machine learning studies how machines or computers learn
            through some training data. Machines improve by seeking
            the pattern within the data and try to achieve some tasks
            without being programmed explicitly to do so. It is considered
            as part of a larger field called Artificial Intelligence. Some interesting
            applications of Machine learning include image recognition, 
            stock trend prediction, and self-driving cars.

        <p class="other-title">Systems programming</p>
        <p class="other-text">
            Systems programming is the process of building system software,
            which are software that make up operating systems. It connects
            the hardware of a computer to the software by building platforms
            that allow other software to operate. It directly interacts with
            the hardware so it usually requires knowledge of computer
            hardware. Systems programming is usually done low level languages like
            C or C++.

        <p class="other-title">Cybersecurity</p>
        <p class="other-text">
            Cybersecurity studies the security of software systems
            from cyber attacks. It aims to discover and fix vulnerabilities
            that may potentially leak sensitive information to hackers.
